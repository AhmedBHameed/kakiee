# KAKIEE

KAKIEE is a simple personal portfolio with technical blog section for sharing knowledge and codes. As a digital entrepreneur with experience, It is a pleasure to share what i've learned. Blogs can help other and show them how to do things in best practice. The name comes from "kaki fruit" which I love so much.
